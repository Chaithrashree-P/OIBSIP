## Wine Quality Prediction

### Idea
Predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, utilizing machine learning to benefit viticulture.

### Dataset
Dataset: [Kaggle Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)

### Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Classifier Models**: Implemented Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
- **Chemical Qualities**: Analyzed features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array operations.
- **Data Visualization**: Employed Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the dataset.

**Conclusion**
Explored machine learning techniques to predict wine quality based on chemical attributes.
